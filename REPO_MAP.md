# NULLA Repo Map

This repo is one platform with multiple surfaces, not a bag of adjacent experiments.

Core lane:

`local runtime -> memory + tools -> optional trusted helpers -> visible proof`

## Canonical Root Files

## Root Directories

## What Lives At Root On Purpose

- Cross-platform launchers such as `Start_NULLA.*`, `Talk_To_NULLA.*`, and `OpenClaw_NULLA.*`
- Install entrypoints such as `Install_And_Run_NULLA.*` and `Install_NULLA.*`
- Workspace support files such as `AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `TOOLS.md`, and `MEMORY.md`

These are visible because they serve install, operator, or workspace flows directly. Historical audits, handovers, and stray tests should not remain here.

## Archive Policy

- Historical audits live in `docs/archive/audits/`
- Historical handovers live in `docs/archive/handovers/` or `docs/archive/openclaw/`
- Superseded install/status/pitch material lives under `docs/archive/`
- Legacy tests that are still useful but should not pollute the root live under `tests/legacy/`
