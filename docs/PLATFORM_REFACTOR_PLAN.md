# NULLA Platform Refactor Plan

Verified against `main` on 2026-03-26.

This is the current extraction plan for turning the repo into a sharper platform without breaking the working lanes.

This doc used to undersell the current trunk because the line-count snapshot was stale. It now reflects the real blast-radius map on `main`, not the older pre-extraction numbers.

The rule for every phase:

- keep the local runtime as the product center
- reduce blast radius instead of adding more mixed logic
- preserve behavior through facades and shims where needed
- run cumulative regression at each step
- keep install/runtime profile truth in one place instead of cloning selection logic into shell scripts and doctor payloads

## Why This Exists

NULLA already has the right system spine:

`local runtime -> memory + tools -> optional trusted helpers -> visible proof`

The repo shape is still carrying too much risk in a small set of giant files. The goal of this plan is to lower change risk without pretending the platform needs a ground-up rewrite.

## Current Execution Phase

The refactor-only pass is frozen. The current beta bar is execution hardening:

- keep the new coding/operator lane real: workspace inspection, diff-based patching, git state, bounded validation, rollback, and emitted artifacts
- keep typed task envelopes live in the routing path instead of letting provider/model decisions drift back to implicit guesses
- keep local envelope execution bounded and real: coder/verifier steps must enforce runtime-tool permissions, queen merge must stay deterministic, dependency order must be explicit, and the bounded path should stay reachable through the real runtime intent surface instead of only direct helper calls
- keep install-profile truth honest: profile selection, disk/RAM expectations, provider-key requirements, and distinct local verifier-lane selection should come from one contract instead of installer folklore
- keep provider capability truth surfaced: role fit, queue depth, safe concurrency, and tool support should stay machine-readable instead of hiding in adapter metadata
- keep provider availability truth honest too: circuit-open lanes must surface as blocked in capability truth, recent-failure lanes should degrade instead of looking fully ready, and routing must reject or penalize them instead of treating “configured” as “available”
- keep runtime provider bootstrap truth shared: default local Ollama plus configured local/remote lanes like vLLM, llama.cpp, and Kimi should register through one seam so backbone snapshots, doctor/install truth, and API bootstrap do not drift apart
- keep install-profile lane truth explicit too: the primary local coder lane should prefer `ollama-local` when it exists, and secondary local verification should prefer verifier-fit locals like `vllm-local` or `llamacpp-local` instead of inheriting whatever provider order the registry happened to return
- keep installer-facing provider truth derived from runtime snapshots too: shell installers, `install_receipt.json`, and `install_doctor.json` must consume `build_provider_registry_snapshot(...).capability_truth` instead of recomputing profile truth from partial local guesses
- keep install-profile health truth honest too: selected provider lanes must carry their live `availability_state`, blocked/unregistered required lanes must fail the profile closed, degraded required lanes must surface as degraded instead of clean, and blocked secondary locals should fall back to a healthier primary local lane instead of pretending a dead distinct verifier lane is useful
- keep task routing and helper-model execution aligned: `core/task_router.py`, `core/provider_routing.py`, and `core/model_teacher_pipeline.py` should share the same locality/pressure/capability truth instead of letting the router promise one lane and the execution path fan out into another, and bounded patch-plus-validation repair work should stay classified as `debugging` instead of falling back to `shell_guidance` or fake-risky routing
- keep helper-model provider health real too: `core/model_teacher_pipeline.py` must skip circuit-open lanes, run `health_check()` before invoke, record success/failure into `core.model_health`, and surface failed attempts in provenance instead of silently discarding dead swarm lanes
- keep the execution planner honest: explicit repo edit requests should plan into bounded queen/coder/verifier envelopes, and the current baseline must support safe search/read/patch/validate flows with fail-closed ambiguity handling instead of falling back to flat tool chains and calling that orchestration
- keep task/proof event truth derived too: bounded envelope lifecycle, receipts, restore/rollback, merge results, and failure state should emit through the existing runtime continuity store so task-rail, operator, and proof surfaces do not invent a second executor-only ledger
- keep bounded debug-loop truth real: when a request is clearly about failing tests plus a concrete repair, the local operator lane should capture pre-patch validation failure, mutate once, and rerun validation cleanly instead of faking a debug loop with a single post-patch green check
- keep validation followup truth real too: explicit pytest/ruff debug requests should route through `workspace.run_tests` / `workspace.run_lint`, failed validation results must feed source inspection or diagnostic search instead of dead-ending after the first red run, the diagnosis path should not stop after the first file read if a bounded followup search is still justified, symbol followups should prefer `workspace.symbol_search` when a repo-meaningful callable/name is visible, search followups should prefer the first unread repo hit instead of re-reading the same failing test forever, and if that first unread implementation read still does not justify a repair the bounded loop should be able to walk the next unread candidate before rerunning validation
- keep candidate-repair promotion narrow and honest: only synthesize a bounded repair envelope from diagnosis when the failing test expectation and unread implementation read make the literal fix explicit, when a one-hop no-arg delegate helper read makes the same literal fix explicit, when the planner can do one explicit delegate lookup and helper read after seeing a trivial wrapper like `return helper()`, or when an already-read implementation returns an imported binding that points at one explicitly-read helper/module with a single conflicting top-level literal binding; otherwise stay read-only and fail closed instead of hallucinating a patch plan
- keep failed-repair cleanup real too: bounded local repair flows should restore the last tracked workspace mutation when the final verifier still fails, while keeping the overall result red instead of masking the failure behind a “successful rollback”
- keep fenced unified-diff repair truth real too: planner must read raw diff blocks before whitespace normalization, and the patch application lane must prefer strict whole-diff application over shell `patch` behavior that can report success after a partial mutation
- keep queen merge truth fail-closed: verifier failure must dominate the merged result for bounded local repair workflows instead of letting an earlier coder success mask a broken final state
- keep bounded recovery truth explicit too: fallback children may only run after failed dependencies when the parent workflow opts in, recovery merges should only prefer a later success when the parent envelope explicitly selects a non-fail-closed merge strategy, and recovery attempts must restore tracked workspace state plus force fresh source timestamps before the retry
- keep Liquefy behind the CLI+JSON boundary in `core/liquefy_client.py` and `core/liquefy_bridge.py`; do not re-import vendor internals
- keep verified procedure promotion local-first and citation-backed instead of narrating “learning” without proof
- keep procedure reuse measurable: local procedure shards should accumulate verified reuse counters and reuse metadata when bounded envelope execution actually succeeds, not just when the router cites them
- keep shard payload reuse real: remote fetches must carry manifest-bound transport metadata, signature validation, explicit fetch receipts, and citation-backed local reuse instead of stopping at metadata-only hints
- keep remote shard reuse measurable too: grounded turns that cite cached remote shards should record downstream success/durable outcomes with selected-vs-answer-backed attribution, and future citations should surface that history instead of treating fetch receipts as the end of the proof path
- keep answer-backed shard credit honest too: a selected remote shard should count as strongly answer-backed only when removing it weakens the grounded plan by confidence or changes the winning evidence source, not merely because it was cited in a successful answer
- keep quality-backed shard credit honest too: a selected remote shard should only count as strongly quality-backed when the final decorated response stays clean, avoids planner leakage/template fallback markers, and does not end in a safe-failure class
- keep remote shard ranking honest: cached `peer_received` shards should get only a bounded preference from proven quality-backed downstream reuse, not a giant static-trust bypass and not a bonus from weaker answer-backed-only history
- keep remote shard reuse scoped too: cached `peer_received` shards must not get ranking or wording credit from unrelated task classes just because the same shard helped somewhere else
- keep operator output disciplined: `core/agent_runtime/response.py` and `core/agent_runtime/response_policy_visibility.py` should keep workflow/routing/capacity internals off chat surfaces unless debug is explicit
- keep concrete Hive task-selection clarifications deterministic too: when the runtime already has real queue rows in hand, `core/agent_runtime/chat_surface.py` must fall back to the truthful queue wording if model prose omits the task titles instead of returning vague “clarify the problem” filler
- keep WAN transport truth honest too: NAT-mapped nodes must not advertise as direct, LAN-only nodes must not claim relay reachability without a real relay path, and dashboard/watch ranking should reflect those transport modes instead of flattening them into fake internet readiness
- keep DHT truth above passive storage: lookup frontier helpers must be able to skip already-contacted peers, stale non-empty buckets must yield deterministic refresh targets before we call the routing table anything more than static storage, fresh full buckets should queue challengers in a bounded replacement cache instead of evicting live incumbents on first contact, maintenance may probe a bounded set of candidate endpoints only when verified coverage is sparse without promoting those candidates into authoritative endpoint truth, and candidate probes need cooldown/failure memory so the same dead referral endpoints are not hammered forever

## Post-Beta Expansion Order

These are real expansion priorities, but they are explicitly post-beta work. They should not displace the current beta bar.

1. Desktop product surface
   - ship a native desktop app wrapper instead of asking normal users to juggle local servers, browser tabs, and trayless scripts
   - keep the local runtime as the source of truth; the desktop app is a product surface, not a second runtime
2. Mobile companion
   - add a real iOS/Android companion surface for querying, watching, and approving work while away from the machine
   - keep heavy execution local-first; mobile is a control/inspection surface first, not a fake phone-hosted swarm
3. Internet-scale data plane
   - harden WAN/DHT/public-internet liveness, multi-endpoint truth, relay/fallback, and churn handling until the Hive can survive outside closed/local clusters without caveats
   - this is the real technical moat after beta, not more mesh mythology
4. Public-web product hardening
   - harden NullaBook/public queues for real hostile internet exposure before pretending it is a broad public social surface
   - operator/task/proof surfaces need rate, abuse, quota, and moderation realism before mass-adoption language
5. Economic rails last
   - real settlement, autonomous spend, and trust rails only after the runtime, proof path, and network are strong enough to justify them
   - credits stay local work/participation accounting until replay protection, reconciliation, idempotent settlement, and abuse resistance are actually real

## Verified Current Risk Snapshot

The current trunk still has a short list of blast-radius centers plus a few newly-thin facades that must not re-bloat:

| File | Lines | Current reality |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| `apps/nulla_agent.py` | 794 | now the thin runtime composition root after the checkpoint, NullaBook, tool-result, Hive-review, and secondary-slab extractions; the remaining risk is re-bloat, not one giant trunk file |
| `core/agent_runtime/chat_surface_facade.py` | 280 | agent-facing chat-surface wrapper glue is now isolated behind a dedicated facade seam |
| `core/agent_runtime/public_hive_support.py` | 187 | agent-facing public-Hive capability/export/footer support is now isolated behind a dedicated runtime seam |
| `core/agent_runtime/task_persistence_support.py` | 195 | task-class updates, task-outcome persistence, verified-action shard promotion, and local shard persistence are now isolated behind a dedicated runtime support seam |
| `core/agent_runtime/proceed_intent_support.py` | 63 | proceed/resume request normalization, explicit resume detection, and generic proceed-message matching are now isolated behind a dedicated runtime intent-policy seam |
| `core/agent_runtime/runtime_checkpoint_support.py` | 205 | now the thin runtime checkpoint facade over the lane-policy, I/O-adapter, and gate-policy seams |
| `core/agent_runtime/runtime_checkpoint_lane_policy.py` | 154 | routing-profile selection, explicit workflow detection, lane-keep policy, and emitted task-envelope metadata now live behind a dedicated checkpoint policy seam |
| `core/agent_runtime/runtime_checkpoint_io_adapter.py` | 96 | checkpoint/task/source-context adapter logic now lives behind a dedicated checkpoint I/O seam |
| `core/agent_runtime/runtime_gate_policy.py` | 38 | runtime approval/gate policy now lives behind a dedicated gate seam |
| `core/runtime_execution_tools.py` | 1579 | this is the real feature hotspot again after Phase 1: it now owns the coding/operator execution baseline, mutation tracking, rollback, validation flow, and bounded envelope execution entrypoint; split it only along behavior seams, not for line-count theater |
| `core/execution/planner.py` | 1711 | this is now a real hotspot too: it owns the operator/research/hive workflow planner, and the bounded search/read/patch/validate, fenced unified-diff repair, preflight-failing-test repair, and narrow delegated-helper repair envelope paths now live here; keep planning truth centralized instead of cloning route logic into callers |
| `core/runtime_tool_contracts.py` | 329 | the operator surface is now explicit here; keep the contract map authoritative and do not let new workspace/git/validation/orchestration actions bypass it |
| `core/runtime_install_profiles.py` | 599 | install/runtime truth hotspot; it now owns profile selection, disk-volume checks, provider-key gating, provider-lane health/availability truth, download/footprint estimates, and distinct configured local verifier-lane selection for heavier local profiles, so keep it as the one authoritative install-profile contract instead of duplicating logic in installers or dashboards |
| `core/provider_routing.py` | 484 | provider routing now owns real envelope-aware locality gating, queue-pressure penalties, and role-fit/capability scoring; keep provider-selection truth here instead of duplicating heuristics in callers |
| `core/task_router.py` | 1082 | task classification, typed envelope emission, route-level model constraints, and the promoted queen lane for explicit patch-and-validate repo work now converge here; keep it as the one place that turns user input into lane hints instead of cloning route heuristics across surfaces |
| `core/model_teacher_pipeline.py` | 474 | helper/teacher candidate generation now records routing requirements/rejections, backs off saturated providers, honors provider health checks/circuit-open skips, and surfaces failed execution attempts in provenance; keep provider-execution truth here instead of reintroducing blind swarm fan-out or silent failure swallowing in callers |
| `core/orchestration/resource_scheduler.py` | 148 | scheduler now owns capacity-state evaluation plus queue-pressure/locality-aware task ordering; keep lane-availability truth here instead of rebuilding it inside the executor |
| `core/liquefy_bridge.py` | 351 | the proof/archive bridge is now a facade over the CLI client and local fallbacks; do not let Liquefy vendor-specific logic leak back into this file |
| `core/liquefy_client.py` | 234 | new CLI+JSON proof adapter; keep it stable and machine-readable instead of turning it into heuristic subprocess glue |
| `installer/doctor.py` | 217 | doctor now reports install-profile readiness, single-volume free-space truth, and top-level `provider_capability_truth` derived from the same runtime provider snapshot seam as the live backbone; do not let it drift into a second install-profile implementation |
| `installer/write_install_receipt.py` | 125 | install receipts now also carry top-level `provider_capability_truth` from the shared runtime provider snapshot; keep machine-readable install truth here instead of cloning it into shell-only summaries |
| `core/orchestration/task_envelope.py` | 111 | typed task-envelope contract is now real and live in routing metadata plus bounded local execution; preserve the schema, role defaults, and permission fields as the stable subtask boundary |
| `core/orchestration/executor.py` | 891 | bounded local subtask executor now enforces capacity-blocked worker lanes, records scheduling details, resolves step-to-step runtime references for the bounded operator lane, supports validation-only allowed-failure preflight capture for bounded repair loops, records verified procedure reuse metrics, fails closed when child-merge truth says the final verifier still lost, and now restores tracked dependency-session workspace state before explicitly-marked fallback recovery children run; keep it focused on local queen/coder/verifier execution and do not let it turn into a second mesh scheduler |
| `core/learning/procedure_shards.py` | 169 | verified procedure persistence is now live and now also carries reuse counters / verified-reuse counters; keep it local-first, citation-backed, and measurable instead of letting it become another vague shard format |
| `core/knowledge_registry.py` | 738 | shareable-shard promotion, manifest binding, dense payload rehydration, and remote-holder search still converge here; keep transport validation and receipt persistence out of this file so it does not become a second mesh stack |
| `core/knowledge_transport.py` | 97 | new shard transport seam for manifest-bound responses and inbound validation; keep it focused on transport truth instead of stuffing search/cache policy into it |
| `core/shard_matcher.py` | 139 | local candidate discovery now also attaches task-class-scoped remote-shard reuse summaries to cached `peer_received` candidates; keep receipt/outcome lookup centralized here instead of duplicating that join in every caller |
| `core/shard_ranker.py` | 98 | candidate scoring now gives bounded priority only to remote shards with quality-backed reuse proof; keep this as the one ranking truth instead of inventing separate Hive-reuse scoring inside loaders or chat surfaces |
| `core/tiered_context_loader.py` | 754 | context assembly is still a real hotspot; remote shard citations, measured reuse-outcome summaries, task-class-scoped quality-backed proof notes, and ranked remote-cache ordering now flow through this loader, so keep it as assembly logic instead of growing a second receipt/transport implementation inside it |
| `storage/shard_reuse_outcomes.py` | 297 | downstream remote-shard reuse outcomes now persist here with selected-vs-answer-backed-vs-quality-backed summaries, optional task-class filtering, and the turn-reasoning-earned `quality_backed` gate; keep the persistence/summary truth here instead of duplicating it in loaders or ranking seams |
| `core/agent_runtime/nullabook_runtime.py` | 264 | NullaBook intent classification, pending-step flow, post/edit/delete/rename handling, and request-text extraction are now isolated behind a dedicated runtime seam |
| `core/agent_runtime/tool_result_surface.py` | 15 | now the thin tool-result facade over the truth-metrics, text-surface, history-surface, and workflow-surface seams |
| `core/agent_runtime/tool_result_truth_metrics.py` | 117 | chat-truth claim metrics and audit logging now live behind a dedicated truth-metrics seam |

| `core/agent_runtime/response_policy.py` | 39 | now the thin response-policy facade over the classification, visibility, and tool-history seams |
| `core/agent_runtime/response_policy_classification.py` | 116 | response classification and direct tool-message shaping now live behind a dedicated policy seam |
| `core/agent_runtime/response_policy_visibility.py` | 85 | workflow/footer visibility rules now live behind a dedicated policy seam |

| `core/dashboard/workstation_client.py` | 532 | the workstation browser-runtime shell is no longer a top-tier hotspot after the card/fold helper, overview/home-runtime, embedded-NullaBook, inspector/truth-selection, and trading/learning extractions, but it still owns the remaining dashboard runtime glue |
| `core/dashboard/workstation_overview_runtime.py` | 14 | now the thin workstation overview facade over the movement and overview-surface seams |

## Current Phase Status

- completed enough to stop pretending they are still untouched: `core/local_operator_actions.py`, `core/control_plane_workspace.py`, `apps/brain_hive_watch_server.py`, `apps/nulla_daemon.py`, `apps/nulla_api_server.py`, `apps/meet_and_greet_server.py`, `core/brain_hive_dashboard.py`, `core/persistent_memory.py`
- materially improved but still active: `core/public_hive/bridge.py`, `apps/nulla_agent.py`, `core/dashboard/workstation_render.py`, `core/dashboard/workstation_client.py`, `core/nullabook_feed_page.py`, `core/nullabook_feed_surface_runtime.py`, `core/brain_hive_service.py`, `core/agent_runtime/hive_research_followup.py`, and `core/agent_runtime/fast_paths.py`
- still the next serious targets: `core/agent_runtime/nullabook.py`, `core/agent_runtime/research_tool_loop_facade.py`, `core/agent_runtime/chat_surface.py`, `core/public_hive/bootstrap.py`, `core/public_hive/publication.py`, `core/public_hive/topic_writes.py`, `core/dashboard/workstation_client.py`, `core/dashboard/snapshot.py`, `core/dashboard/topic.py`, and `core/agent_runtime/hive_topic_facade.py`
- startup/provider state is now also centralized behind `core/runtime_backbone.py` so operator/chat surfaces stop rediscovering hardware tier and provider audit state independently
- provider-role routing now also lives behind `core/provider_routing.py`, and both the helper/teacher lane and the main model execution router now honor bounded drone/queen provider roles without broad caller rewiring
- envelope-aware provider routing is now also real instead of passive metadata: local-private or mutating coder envelopes fail closed without a valid local provider, and candidate scoring now incorporates queue depth vs safe concurrency instead of pretending every ranked manifest is equally available
- envelope scheduling is now also capacity-aware when task envelopes already carry provider-capability truth: queue pressure can degrade lane priority, incompatible local-write lanes can fail closed before execution, and queen execution now exposes scheduling details instead of only child order
- chat-surface wording, observation shaping, and Hive status narration now also live behind `core/agent_runtime/chat_surface.py`, and the agent-facing wrapper surface now also lives behind `core/agent_runtime/chat_surface_facade.py`, so `apps/nulla_agent.py` no longer owns that slab directly

- that operator leak cleanup now also covers newer routing/capacity payloads: capacity-blocked worker failures, routing requirement blobs, rejected-candidate JSON, and helper-lane backoff markers now resolve to terse user-safe operator wording instead of raw scheduler/provider payloads
- public-Hive capability/help wrappers, task export, footer support, public capability ledger shaping, and transport-mode helpers now also live behind `core/agent_runtime/public_hive_support.py`, so `apps/nulla_agent.py` no longer owns that outward support slab directly

- public-copy privacy policy now also fans out to `core/agent_runtime/hive_topic_public_copy_safety.py` and `core/agent_runtime/hive_topic_public_copy_transcript.py`, so `core/agent_runtime/hive_topic_public_copy_privacy.py` is now just the thin privacy facade

- live-info mode and runtime helpers now also fan out to `core/agent_runtime/fast_live_info_mode_markers.py`, `core/agent_runtime/fast_live_info_mode_rules.py`, `core/agent_runtime/fast_live_info_mode_classifier.py`, `core/agent_runtime/fast_live_info_mode_failure.py`, `core/agent_runtime/fast_live_info_mode_query.py`, `core/agent_runtime/fast_live_info_mode_recency.py`, `core/agent_runtime/fast_live_info_runtime_flow.py`, `core/agent_runtime/fast_live_info_runtime_results.py`, `core/agent_runtime/fast_live_info_runtime_search.py`, and `core/agent_runtime/fast_live_info_runtime_truth.py`, leaving `core/agent_runtime/fast_live_info_mode_policy.py` and `core/agent_runtime/fast_live_info_runtime.py` as tiny facades

Quarantine in narrative and architecture priority:

- settlement / token / DEX / marketplace layers
- anything that reads broader than the current proof path

Current execution-phase rule:

- do not go back to refactor-for-refactor’s-sake
- only split a file when new execution work exposes a real mixed-responsibility failure
- prefer stronger contracts, safer receipts, and verified end-to-end work over smaller line counts

## Phase Order

### Phase 1 - Extract `core/execution/` from `core/tool_intent_executor.py`

Status on trunk:

- `core/execution/` is already live with planner, models, receipts, web tools, and Hive tools
- the coding/operator baseline is now also live with `core/execution/workspace_tools.py`, `core/execution/git_tools.py`, `core/execution/validation_tools.py`, and `core/execution/artifacts.py`, and the write/rollback seams now have to preserve fresh source timestamps across repeated write/rollback/write cycles instead of trusting wall-clock luck
- `core/liquefy_bridge.py` now sits on the optional CLI+JSON adapter in `core/liquefy_client.py` / `core/liquefy_models.py` instead of importing vendor internals directly
- typed task envelopes and local procedure learning are now also live behind `core/orchestration/` and `core/learning/`
- `core/tool_intent_executor.py` is down to 446 lines
- this is no longer a top-tier monolith; keep the facade thin and stop letting new execution concerns leak back in

Create:

- `core/execution/__init__.py`
- `core/execution/capability_registry.py`
- `core/execution/capability_truth.py`
- `core/execution/policy.py`
- `core/execution/planner.py`
- `core/execution/dispatcher.py`
- `core/execution/render.py`

Move:

- `runtime_capability_ledger()`
- `supported_public_capability_tags()`
- `capability_truth_for_request()`
- `should_attempt_tool_intent()`
- `plan_tool_workflow()`
- `execute_tool_intent()`
- `render_capability_truth_response()`

Keep `core/tool_intent_executor.py` as a shim for one release.

Targeted regression:

```bash
pytest -q \
  tests/test_tool_intent_executor.py \
  tests/test_runtime_capability_ledger.py \
  tests/test_runtime_tool_registry_contract.py \
  tests/test_tool_registry_contracts.py \
  tests/test_runtime_execution_tools.py
```

Cumulative gate:

```bash

  tests/test_runtime_execution_tools.py \
  tests/test_nulla_runtime_contracts.py \
  tests/test_openclaw_tooling_context.py
```

### Phase 2 - Split `core/local_operator_actions.py` into `core/operator/`

Status on trunk:

- `core/operator/` is already live with models, parser, registry, approvals, handlers, and storage helpers
- `core/local_operator_actions.py` is down to 392 lines
- this is no longer a top-tier monolith unless new work starts growing the facade again

Create:

- `core/operator/__init__.py`
- `core/operator/models.py`
- `core/operator/parser.py`
- `core/operator/dispatch.py`
- `core/operator/registry.py`
- `core/operator/guardrails.py`
- `core/operator/handlers/__init__.py`
- `core/operator/handlers/calendar.py`
- `core/operator/handlers/filesystem.py`
- `core/operator/handlers/processes.py`
- `core/operator/handlers/system.py`

Move:

- `OperatorActionIntent`
- `parse_operator_action_intent()`
- `dispatch_operator_action()`

Keep `core/local_operator_actions.py` as a shim for one release.

Targeted regression:

```bash
pytest -q \
  tests/test_operator_actions.py \
  tests/test_runtime_execution_tools.py \
  tests/test_nulla_runtime_contracts.py
```

Cumulative gate:

```bash

  tests/test_runtime_execution_tools.py \
  tests/test_operator_actions.py \
  tests/test_nulla_runtime_contracts.py \
  tests/test_openclaw_tooling_context.py
```

### Phase 3 - Refactor `core/public_hive_bridge.py` into `core/public_hive/`

Status on trunk:

- `core/public_hive/__init__.py`, `auth.py`, `bootstrap.py`, `bridge.py`, `client.py`, `config.py`, `truth.py`, `topic_writes.py`, `publication.py`, and `moderation.py` are already live
- `core/public_hive_bridge.py` is down to 69 lines and now delegates through the 25-line `core/public_hive/bridge_facade_compat.py` plus the stable compat facades
- `core/public_hive/bridge_support.py` is now the 36-line compat-support facade over `core/public_hive/bridge_support_paths.py`, `core/public_hive/bridge_support_env.py`, and `core/public_hive/bridge_support_runtime.py`
- `core/public_hive/bridge.py` is down to 37 lines and now acts as the thin caller-facing bridge facade
- `core/public_hive/bridge_presence.py` is now the 13-line grouped presence facade over `core/public_hive/bridge_presence_sync.py` (55), `core/public_hive/bridge_presence_nullabook.py` (47), and `core/public_hive/bridge_presence_commons.py` (25)
- `core/public_hive/bridge_topics.py` is now the 15-line grouped topic facade over `core/public_hive/bridge_topic_reads.py` (59), `core/public_hive/bridge_topic_reviews.py` (35), `core/public_hive/bridge_topic_writes.py` (13), and `core/public_hive/bridge_topic_publication.py` (53)
- `core/public_hive/bridge_facade_bootstrap.py` is now the 11-line compat-bootstrap facade over `core/public_hive/bridge_facade_bootstrap_write.py`, `core/public_hive/bridge_facade_bootstrap_sync.py`, and `core/public_hive/bridge_facade_bootstrap_auth.py`
- `core/public_hive/bridge_topic_post_writes.py` is now the 13-line grouped post-write facade over `core/public_hive/bridge_topic_post_progress_writes.py`, `core/public_hive/bridge_topic_post_result_writes.py`, and `core/public_hive/bridge_topic_post_status_writes.py`
- `core/public_hive/bridge_transport.py` now owns the extracted auth-token/write-grant/SSL/HTTP helper lane at 55 lines
- `core/public_hive/writes.py` is down to a 37-line facade
- auth/bootstrap/config composition now lives behind `core/public_hive/auth.py`
- the remaining public-Hive risk is now mostly `core/public_hive/bootstrap.py`, `core/public_hive/publication.py`, and `core/public_hive/topic_writes.py`, not the grouped compat/presence helper facades
- the main slow-lane model router now reads `provider_role` from `core/task_router.py` and resolves ranked candidates through `core/provider_routing.py` inside `core/memory_first_router.py`

Create:

- `core/public_hive/__init__.py`
- `core/public_hive/config.py`
- `core/public_hive/client.py`
- `core/public_hive/auth.py`
- `core/public_hive/privacy.py`
- `core/public_hive/topic_service.py`
- `core/public_hive/publish_service.py`
- `core/public_hive/profile_service.py`
- `core/public_hive/bootstrap.py`
- `core/public_hive/topic_writes.py`
- `core/public_hive/publication.py`
- `core/public_hive/moderation.py`

Move:

- `PublicHiveBridgeConfig`
- topic lifecycle methods
- publish/update/result methods
- profile sync methods
- client/auth helpers

Hard boundary:

- all outbound public writes must flow through `core/public_hive/privacy.py`

Keep `core/public_hive_bridge.py` as the stable facade for one release.
Keep `core/public_hive/writes.py` as the stable write-facade for one release.

Targeted regression:

```bash
pytest -q \
  tests/test_public_hive_bridge.py \
  tests/test_brain_hive_service.py \
  tests/test_nullabook_api.py \
  tests/test_meet_and_greet_service.py
```

Cumulative gate:

```bash
pytest -q \
  tests/test_public_hive_bridge.py \
  tests/test_brain_hive_service.py \
  tests/test_nullabook_api.py \
  tests/test_meet_and_greet_service.py \

  tests/test_nullabook_profile_page.py \
  tests/test_brain_hive_watch_server.py \
  tests/test_public_web_browser_smoke.py
```

### Phase 4 - Thin `apps/nulla_agent.py` into a composition root

Status on trunk:

- this phase is actively in progress, not hypothetical
- `apps/nulla_agent.py` is down to 781 lines from the older 11k+ state
- extracted runtime seams now include checkpoints, fast paths, response shaping, public-Hive support, task persistence support, proceed-intent support, presence, builder support/controller, NullaBook, memory runtime, orchestrator helpers, Hive runtime/topics/create/followups, turn dispatch/frontdoor/reasoning, runtime checkpoint support, tool-result surface support, and Hive review runtime
- fast-path wrapper glue now lives behind `core/agent_runtime/fast_path_facade.py`, so `apps/nulla_agent.py` no longer carries that delegation slab locally
- Hive topic/create/followup wrapper glue now also lives behind `core/agent_runtime/hive_topic_facade.py`, so `apps/nulla_agent.py` no longer carries that delegation slab locally
- builder workflow/scaffold wrapper glue now also lives behind `core/agent_runtime/builder_facade.py`, so `apps/nulla_agent.py` no longer carries that delegation slab locally
- research/live-web/tool-loop wrapper glue now also lives behind `core/agent_runtime/research_tool_loop_facade.py`, so `apps/nulla_agent.py` no longer carries that delegation slab locally
- chat-surface wording/observation/Hive status logic now also lives behind `core/agent_runtime/chat_surface.py`, and the agent-facing wrapper glue now also lives behind `core/agent_runtime/chat_surface_facade.py`, so `apps/nulla_agent.py` no longer carries that surface-shaping slab locally
- credit commands, capability/help responses, credit status rendering, and fast/action result glue now also live behind `core/agent_runtime/fast_command_surface.py`, so `apps/nulla_agent.py` no longer carries that command-surface slab locally
- response classification, workflow/footer visibility policy, and tool-history observation shaping now also live behind `core/agent_runtime/response_policy.py`, so `apps/nulla_agent.py` no longer carries that response-policy slab locally
- public-Hive capability/help wrappers, task export, footer support, public capability ledger shaping, and transport-mode helpers now also live behind `core/agent_runtime/public_hive_support.py`, so `apps/nulla_agent.py` no longer carries that outward public-support slab locally
- task-class updates, task-outcome persistence, verified-action shard promotion, and local shard persistence now also live behind `core/agent_runtime/task_persistence_support.py`, so `apps/nulla_agent.py` no longer carries that persistence/support slab locally
- proceed/resume request normalization, explicit resume detection, and generic proceed-message matching now also live behind `core/agent_runtime/proceed_intent_support.py`, so `apps/nulla_agent.py` no longer carries that intent-policy slab locally
- runtime checkpoint lifecycle, routing-profile selection, source-context merging, and patch-sensitive runtime/tool compatibility now also live behind `core/agent_runtime/runtime_checkpoint_support.py`, so `apps/nulla_agent.py` no longer carries that checkpoint/tool bridge slab locally
- NullaBook intent classification, pending-step flow, post/edit/delete/rename handling, and request text extraction now also live behind `core/agent_runtime/nullabook_runtime.py`, so `apps/nulla_agent.py` no longer carries that operator-facing NullaBook slab locally
- workflow attachment, user-facing response shaping, planner-leak stripping, workflow summaries, and tool-history observation shaping now also live behind `core/agent_runtime/tool_result_surface.py`, so `apps/nulla_agent.py` no longer carries that response-surface slab locally
- Hive review queue/action/cleanup handling now also lives behind `core/agent_runtime/hive_review_runtime.py`, so `apps/nulla_agent.py` no longer carries that review-command slab locally
- provider swarm/routing glue for the helper lane now also lives behind `core/provider_routing.py` and `core/model_teacher_pipeline.py`, so provider-role decisions stop leaking into callers
- the root is now below the 1k-line bar, so the remaining risk is re-bloat, not one giant trunk file

Target packages:

- `core/runtime/`
- `core/conversation/`
- `core/memory/`
- `core/execution/`
- `core/public_hive/`

What is already true on trunk:

- `core/persistent_memory.py` is down to 202 lines and now acts as the stable facade over `core/memory/files.py`, `policies.py`, `entries.py`, and `learning.py`
- API, meet, daemon, and watch entrypoints are already thin facades or ASGI-backed service roots
- the remaining work is concentrated inside the agent runtime and the large dashboard/public-surface modules, not the old entry shells

Keep out of `apps/nulla_agent.py`:

- checkpoint lifecycle, routing-profile selection, source-context merging, and patch-sensitive runtime/tool compatibility in `core/agent_runtime/runtime_checkpoint_support.py`
- NullaBook intent/pending/post mutation flow in `core/agent_runtime/nullabook_runtime.py`
- workflow attachment, response shaping, planner-leak stripping, and tool-history observation shaping in `core/agent_runtime/tool_result_surface.py`
- review queue/action/cleanup logic in `core/agent_runtime/hive_review_runtime.py`
- all existing builder/support/presence/public-Hive/response seams that already left the root

### Phase 6 - Split `core/control_plane_workspace.py`

Status on trunk:

- `core/control_plane/metrics_views.py`, `policies.py`, `queue_views.py`, `runtime_views.py`, `schemas.py`, and `templates.py` are already live
- `core/control_plane_workspace.py` is down to 558 lines
- this phase is mostly complete; only finish deeper repo/sync separation if the file starts re-coupling again

Create:

- `core/control_plane/workspace_paths.py`
- `core/control_plane/workspace_repo.py`
- `core/control_plane/workspace_sync.py`
- `core/control_plane/queue_views.py`
- `core/control_plane/proof_views.py`
- `core/control_plane/adaptation_views.py`

Rule:

- `workspace_sync.py` may mutate files
- `*_views.py` may query and shape data
- `workspace_repo.py` is the storage boundary

## Current Beta Execution Frontier

- Bounded local repair can now keep diagnosing after a failed repair envelope, but only when the nested verifier failure is explicit and the tracked rollback succeeded. That is deliberate; anything broader would turn into guessy retry spam.
- That same lane can now take one bounded second repair shot when the post-rollback diagnosis becomes explicit. It still does not get infinite retries, and it still does not guess without concrete read/search evidence.
- That retry lane also stops obeying stale explicit replacement text from the original prompt once a failed repair envelope has rolled back cleanly. After that point, only the newer diagnosis evidence can justify the next bounded patch attempt.
- That same bounded lane now also handles the narrow `NAME = <literal>` / `return NAME` case when the binding lives in the same file and is unique. It still fails closed on repeated bindings, imported names, and any wider constant chasing.
- Bounded local envelope execution now emits append-only `task_envelope_*` lifecycle/proof events through the existing runtime continuity store, so task-rail and operator proof/status surfaces can derive start, step, dependency, rollback, merge, and final result truth from one event spine instead of executor-local details.
- DHT lookup candidates now also prefer fresh peers over stale ones instead of treating age-blind XOR closeness as good enough, referral-only `NODE_FOUND` / `BLOCK_FOUND` endpoints are now candidate-only instead of authoritative transport rows, weaker referral gossip no longer refreshes observed-peer liveness or stale-bucket freshness as if it were a real live contact, and maintenance can now probe a bounded set of candidate endpoints when verified discovery coverage is thin without upgrading those candidates into live endpoint truth for free. Candidate endpoints now also carry probe cooldown/failure memory so the same dead referrals do not get hammered every tick.
- Signed assist/daemon ingress now also persists proof-backed observed backup endpoints instead of discarding that liveness after validation. Maintenance can prefer those verified backups before raw candidate probes, but the authoritative endpoint row is still single-primary plus verified-backup memory, not full multi-endpoint truth yet.
- Provider routing truth is now a little less fake too: capability snapshots now carry availability state from recent provider health, circuit-open lanes get rejected instead of ranked like live candidates, and degraded lanes take a real routing penalty instead of hiding behind the same config-only manifest truth as healthy providers.
- The next real gaps are still multi-hop repo debugging, deeper queen/coder/verifier retry-and-merge behavior, provider rollout beyond the current contract truth, stronger measured Hive-reuse impact on completion quality beyond task-class-scoped proof, and WAN/DHT hardening around authoritative multi-endpoint truth, signed liveness proof promotion rules, and public-internet churn.

## Shared Refactor Rules

- Do not combine two blast-radius modules in one PR.
- Keep old import paths alive for one release when extracting hot paths.
- Move pure helpers first, then mutable/orchestration logic.
- Do not grow `brain_hive_dashboard.py`, `tool_intent_executor.py`, `public_hive_bridge.py`, `local_operator_actions.py`, or `control_plane_workspace.py` while their split PR is open.
- Public write privacy must stay fail-closed for public surfaces.
- Current limitations stay explicit in runtime behavior and docs.

## Full End Gate

Every phase closes with:

```bash
pytest tests/ -q
```

And, when relevant:

```bash
python3 ops/cumulative_stabilization.py --through G
```

If the phase touches public surfaces:

- run local browser smoke
- run live public smoke with disposable tags
- verify cleanup before calling the phase done

## Done Means

The plan is complete only when:

- the runtime center is clearer from imports alone
- the highest-risk files are materially smaller
- package boundaries are easier to reason about
- public proofs still work
- cumulative regression stays green at each phase

No big-bang rewrite. No “clean architecture” cosplay. Extract, prove, keep moving.
