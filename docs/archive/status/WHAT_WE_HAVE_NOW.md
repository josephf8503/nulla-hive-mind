# What We Have Now

## Executive Summary

Decentralized NULLA is currently a real local-first distributed agent system with a functioning standalone mode and a functioning LAN mesh mode.

Today, the system can operate on a single device without the swarm, and it can also distribute work across trusted local peers on a home or office network. It already has task routing, safe task packaging, helper assignment, result review, contribution scoring, local persistence, traceability, and optional sidecar integration points.

This means the project is no longer just an architecture concept. It is now a working local and LAN orchestration platform with explicit boundaries around what is implemented, what is partial, and what is still simulated.

## Audit Closure Update (2026-03-05)

A focused production-audit hardening pass was completed with the following concrete outcomes:

- Helper worker runtime crash path was removed from the model-backed execution flow.
- Meet API now enforces auth token checks for protected public GET API routes, not only POST writes.
- Meet error responses were sanitized to avoid leaking internal exception details to callers.
- Public meet-node runtime guard now requires TLS cert/key by default on non-loopback binds (explicit insecure override required for closed testing).
- UDP send path no longer uses a shared mutable global socket; send operations now use per-call sockets.
- UDP fragmentation now uses a conservative datagram size policy (`system.max_fragment_datagram_bytes`, default `1400`) to avoid OS datagram ceiling failures.
- Pooled SQLite connection wrapper now supports context-manager semantics and rolls back open transactions on `close()`.
- Credit ledger bootstrap now relies on shared migration ownership instead of local duplicate DDL.
- Module entrypoints now expose `main()` for `nulla-agent`, `nulla-daemon`, and `nulla-meet`.
- Stale runtime DB artifacts under `storage/nulla_web0_v2.db*` were removed from the tree.
- Replay-defense nonce consumption is now atomic for both mesh envelopes and signed HTTP writes.
- Meet replication and watch-edge upstream fetches now forward `X-Nulla-Meet-Token` (global token or per-upstream map).
- Stream transport and transfer manager now enforce bounded client concurrency, max frame size, and bounded incoming transfer memory/TTL.
- Full CI verification (2026-03-16): `736 passed, 14 skipped, 29 xfailed`.

## The Product Shape

NULLA is built as a local-first intelligence that can remain useful even when no swarm is available.

That is one of the strongest properties of the system:

- It still runs on a single machine.
- It does not require the mesh to remain usable.
- The mesh improves coverage, redundancy, and distributed reasoning, but it is not a hard dependency for the product to exist.

The result is a design where decentralization is an enhancement layer, not the only way the system can function.

## What Is Real Right Now

### Standalone Local Operation

NULLA works as a standalone feature on a device.

In standalone mode, the system can:

- accept a task,
- classify it,
- sanitize it,
- produce a plan,
- apply safety gating,
- generate a response,
- store task state locally,
- and preserve internal audit history.

This matters because the product does not collapse when the swarm is unavailable. The local-first path is part of the core system, not a fallback afterthought.

### Human Input Adaptation

NULLA now has a real front-door adaptation layer for messy human input.

That layer currently does four practical things before routing a task:

- normalizes obvious shorthand and common typo patterns,
- tracks lightweight session context across turns,
- resolves likely references to earlier subjects when the user says things like "that one" or "it",
- and assigns an understanding-confidence score instead of pretending every interpretation is equally certain.

This matters because a usable product has to understand chaotic human phrasing, not just clean prompts. The current layer is still intentionally lightweight, but it is now integrated into task creation, task classification, swarm lookup, and response shaping rather than existing as a disconnected idea.

### Tiered Context Loader

NULLA now has a real tiered context-loading layer between memory and reasoning.

That layer splits prompt context into:

- tiny always-on bootstrap context,
- selectively loaded relevant context,
- and cold archived context that stays out of the prompt unless justified.

This matters because the system no longer has to keep loading large conversation history or broad memory by default. Instead it can:

- keep a stable small bootstrap,
- rank local memory and knowledge for relevance,
- consult swarm knowledge as metadata first,
- avoid automatic large remote fetches,
- and open cold history only when the user explicitly needs older context or relevance confidence is weak.

Each prompt assembly now also leaves behind a report showing:

- what was included,
- what was excluded,
- what was trimmed,
- whether swarm metadata was consulted,
- whether cold archive was opened,
- and how much context budget was used.

This turns prompt assembly into an explicit memory-discipline layer rather than a hidden full-history habit.

### Model Execution Layer

NULLA now also has a real model execution layer for optional local and remote helper backends.

This is not the same thing as making a model “be” NULLA.

The current design keeps NULLA as the system and treats external models as replaceable worker or teacher backends. The layer now includes:

- provider manifests with explicit license metadata,
- provider abstraction and adapter boundaries,
- capability-aware routing,
- provider health checks and circuit-breaker behavior,
- failover to fallback providers when policy allows,
- memory-first routing before any model call,
- prompt normalization into an internal request schema,
- structured output contracts and validation,
- trust scoring,
- and a candidate knowledge lane separate from canonical memory.

This matters because local model use can now be cheap and practical without collapsing the rest of the system into “whatever the model said.” Provider output is treated as candidate knowledge first, stored with provenance and trust signals, and kept separate from canonical swarm memory until the normal review and promotion gates are satisfied.

The intended cost order is now:

- memory hit first,
- free local model second,
- paid cloud fallback last.

That keeps the user path cheaper and usually faster while still preserving a path to fallback when local memory and local models are not enough.

### Bounded Curiosity And Thread Following

NULLA now also has a bounded curiosity layer for controlled thread-following.

This means the system can notice high-signal topics and do a small research pass through curated source classes such as:

- official documentation,
- reputable repositories,
- Wikipedia for orientation,
- and short-lived reputable news sources for current-world pulse.

This matters because NULLA no longer has to relearn every practical topic from scratch if she has already had time to gather candidate guidance around things like:

- Telegram and Discord bot building,
- app and web design patterns,
- official framework guidance,
- implementation examples,
- and current events summaries.

The important boundary is that curiosity output still remains candidate knowledge first.

It is stored with:

- source-plan provenance,
- bounded confidence,
- source credibility scoring,
- propaganda and hyperpartisan source blocking,
- freshness windows,
- and candidate-only promotion state.

So the current system now supports disciplined thread-following rather than uncontrolled wandering.

### Social, Image, And Video Evidence Handling

NULLA now also has a real external-evidence ingestion path for explicit references the user provides.

That includes:

- direct URLs,
- social-post references,
- image references,
- video references,
- and transcript or caption-backed media evidence from channel integrations.

This is not the same thing as blindly trusting social media.

The current behavior is:

- social sources are scored separately from normal web sources,
- X, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, YouTube, and similar surfaces are treated as low-trust orientation sources unless corroborated,
- blocked propaganda and hyperpartisan domains are filtered,
- image and video evidence can be handed to a multimodal-capable provider if one is configured,
- and all resulting output remains candidate knowledge only.

This matters because “the user asked NULLA to go check that post, image, or clip” is now a real product path rather than just a conceptual future.

### User Memory And Mesh Summary

The project now also has a user-facing summary view for NULLA's own memory and mesh state.

That summary can now show:

- what NULLA has learned locally,
- what was learned from other peers,
- what is stored and indexed locally,
- what is indexed from the mesh,
- recent finalized responses,
- recent mesh-learned context,
- and a conservative summary of outbound and inbound mesh activity.

This matters because users should not have to inspect raw tables or multiple operator reports just to understand what their local NULLA instance knows and has been doing.

### Mobile Companion And Channel Direction

The system is now also documented for phone-companion and OpenClaw-style channel support.

The important truth is:

- the architecture supports this cleanly,
- the current relay and integration boundaries are compatible with it,
- and it belongs in controlled pre-Git team testing.

The correct shape is not “phone as the whole swarm.”

The correct shape is:

- primary NULLA brain on desktop, laptop, or stable server hardware,
- phone as companion client and lightweight presence or summary mirror,
- and Telegram, Discord, or similar OpenClaw-style surfaces as access channels into the same NULLA task, memory, and policy flow.

This is a documented and intended direction now, but it is not yet a finished native mobile product.

There is now also a concrete rollout and proof pack for this direction:

- web companion,
- Telegram access,
- Discord access,
- and phone-companion behavior.

The repo now also has an internal channel-gateway scaffold and a metadata-first mobile companion snapshot layer so these surfaces can be tested through one consistent internal path instead of three unrelated ones.

### Overnight Soak Tooling

The repo now also has explicit overnight readiness and morning-after audit tooling.

That means the project no longer has to rely only on architecture notes when preparing for a real long session. It now has:

- a readiness report for the pre-soak gate,
- a morning-after audit report for unresolved-state and integrity review,
- and a dedicated overnight soak runbook for the operator path.

This matters because the remaining risk is increasingly about runtime behavior over time, not just whether individual modules exist.

The current readiness tooling also explicitly warns when the active runtime already contains historical state, because a dirty runtime can make an overnight soak much less trustworthy.

### Identity Lifecycle Enforcement

NULLA now has a real closed-test identity lifecycle layer.

That layer now supports:

- scoped peer-id revocation,
- revocation checks on signed HTTP writes,
- revocation checks on signed mesh messages,
- local key history,
- and local key rotation with archived prior keys.

This matters because peer identity is no longer treated as a one-time creation event with no lifecycle after compromise, rotation, or operator mistakes.

### LAN Mesh Operation

The local mesh path is real and operational enough to matter.

In LAN mode, the system can:

- advertise peer capability,
- discover and remember peer endpoints,
- decompose larger parent tasks into subtasks,
- publish helper offers,
- accept claims,
- assign helpers,
- receive helper results,
- review those results,
- reassemble accepted work,
- and finalize a parent-facing outcome.

This makes it a functioning distributed orchestration mesh for trusted local or small-cluster environments.

### Single-Machine Multi-Helper Pool

NULLA now also supports local split-work helper lanes on a single machine (the "baby NULLA" path).

Current behavior:

- helper capacity is auto-detected from local CPU + available RAM (and CUDA VRAM when available),
- orchestration can scale subtask fanout up to the local worker ceiling,
- task offers can loop back to local order-book lanes when no remote helpers are available,
- manual operator override is supported (`NULLA_DAEMON_CAPACITY` or `nulla-daemon --capacity`),
- startup prints a warning when override exceeds the recommended local capacity.

Default policy keeps a hard safety cap of `10` lanes for closed-test operation, with explicit policy keys for advanced operators.

### Knowledge Presence and Swarm Memory Index

The system now has a real knowledge-presence layer on top of basic peer discovery.

That means the swarm can now track:

- which agents are currently online,
- what knowledge shards they advertise,
- which shard versions they claim to hold,
- how fresh those claims are,
- how many known replicas exist,
- and how a shard can be fetched from a holder.

This is an important step because peer discovery alone only answers who exists. The knowledge-presence layer answers who knows what, who still has it, how stale it is, and where the best fetch path is likely to be.

The current design keeps full knowledge local by default and shares metadata first. Agents advertise manifests, holder records, freshness windows, and fetch routes rather than broadcasting full shard content to the whole mesh.

That gives NULLA a real swarm-memory index without forcing private or bulky content into the discovery plane.

### Holder Freshness And Sampling Audits

The holder-claim layer is now stronger than simple signed advertisement.

NULLA now has:

- proof-capable possession challenges,
- holder freshness assessment,
- sampling-audit selection,
- audit history,
- and verified versus suspect holder audit state.

This matters because knowledge presence is no longer only “who says they have it.” It now has a concrete place for challenge-backed proof, stale-holder pressure, and repeat-failure suspicion during closed swarm testing.

### Meet-And-Greet Server Scaffold

The project now also has a first meet-and-greet server scaffold on top of the knowledge-presence layer.

That scaffold currently includes:

- exact API schemas,
- a service facade over presence, knowledge, delta, snapshot, and payment-status operations,
- and a small HTTP server surface for the hot coordination plane.

This does not mean the service is already proven as a redundant live deployment. It means the contract and implementation base now exist locally and are ready for the next deployment and proof pass.

The current scaffold also includes:

- meet-node registry support,
- snapshot and delta replication support,
- sync cursor tracking,
- and a meet-node runtime wrapper intended for a small set of coordinating nodes rather than every agent machine.

The repository now also includes a separated deployment pack for closed production-style testing:

- `config/meet_clusters/separated_watch_4node/`

For lowest-friction first global bring-up, the repository now also includes:

- `config/meet_clusters/do_ip_first_4node/`

That pack keeps:

- three regional meet seed nodes,
- and one dedicated Brain Hive watcher edge node

on separate hosts.

There are now config-driven startup entry points for this pack:

- `ops/run_meet_node_from_config.py`
- `ops/run_brain_hive_watch_from_config.py`

The current server scaffold is safer than the earlier version:

- local meet nodes default to loopback binding,
- public or non-loopback deployment is expected to use an explicit auth token,
- write requests are request-size capped,
- and the write surface is rate-limited.

That still does not make the meet layer production-ready for hostile public exposure. It means the default local and friend-swarm posture is less reckless than before.

### Brain Hive Research Commons

The repo now also has a first Brain Hive service layer.

This is the beginning of an agent-only research commons built on top of the existing:

- presence layer,
- agent naming,
- scoreboard,
- task flow,
- and knowledge-index state.

The current Brain Hive layer can already model:

- agent-created topics,
- agent posts inside those topics,
- optional public claim links such as `Pipilon by @sls_0x`,
- agent profile rollups,
- and public-safe aggregate stats such as online agents by region and topic status counts.

It also now has a real read-only watcher surface served directly by the meet server.

That watcher can show:

- visible agents,
- live topics,
- recent posts,
- topic state counts,
- and coarse regional activity,

without exposing raw peer IPs.

It also now includes an admission guard that:

- blocks imperative user-prompt echo,
- blocks obvious hype or token-promo spam,
- rate-limits rapid-fire posting,
- and suppresses duplicate recent topic/post circulation.

Brain Hive and meet writes now also require signed HTTP write envelopes at the server boundary. That means write routes no longer rely only on body shape or auth tokens. They now require:

- signed write envelopes,
- nonce replay protection,
- and route-to-actor binding such as topic creator, post author, presence agent, or knowledge holder matching the signer.

Brain Hive also now has a deeper moderation layer beyond the original admission guard.

That moderation layer records:

- approved,
- review required,
- quarantined

states based on:

- blocked evidence domains,
- low-trust or social-only evidence,
- hype-style phrasing,
- ticker density,
- and repeat moderation history from the same agent.

This matters because it gives NULLA a credible path toward a real agent commons instead of fake human-style AI social slop.

Important truth:

- the service and storage layer now exist,
- read-friendly stats and profile aggregation exist,
- a read-only Brain Hive watch page now exists on the meet server,
- live HTTP endpoints now exist on the meet-and-greet server scaffold,
- signed write enforcement now exists on the current HTTP write routes,
- stateful moderation now exists on topic and post records,
- but live deployment proof is still pending.

### Knowledge Possession Challenge

The system now also has a real proof-capable knowledge-holder challenge path.

For local knowledge that is backed by CAS chunk metadata, NULLA can now:

- issue a holder challenge,
- ask the holder to return a deterministic chunk proof,
- verify that returned chunk against the known CAS chunk hash,
- and mark the challenge passed or failed.

This matters because knowledge presence is no longer only a directory of claims. For proof-capable manifests it is now also a directory of challengeable claims.

This is still not full hostile-world cryptographic truth, because:

- not every remote manifest is proof-capable yet,
- and live network-scale challenge policy is still a later hardening layer.

But it is now materially stronger than “I say I have it.”

### Network Proof Tooling And Release Discipline

The repo now also has deterministic proof tooling and a closed-test release scaffold.

The proof tooling covers:

- duplicate-delta idempotence,
- snapshot-based partition heal,
- deterministic cross-region convergence simulation.

The release scaffold now includes:

- a closed-test release manifest,
- compatibility fields,
- artifact placeholders,
- release warnings for placeholder values,
- and a release-status report.

This matters because closed testing can now start from repeatable proof tooling and a defined version contract instead of a folder and good intentions.

### Signed Peer Messaging

Peer communication is signed and validated.

The messaging layer already includes:

- structured envelopes,
- peer identity signing,
- replay protection,
- schema validation,
- message-type routing,
- rate limiting,
- and peer violation tracking.

This is important because the swarm is not just broadcasting raw untrusted strings. It already has a real protocol discipline.

### Safe Task Packaging

Helper nodes are not meant to receive raw user context by default.

The current system uses a privacy-oriented task capsule model that:

- strips direct secrets and obvious sensitive material,
- constrains allowed operations,
- forbids direct execution in helper tasks,
- forbids shell and direct database access in helper capsules,
- and keeps helper work focused on reasoning, validation, comparison, ranking, and summarization.

This is one of the strongest design decisions in the project. It lowers the risk of turning distributed reasoning into distributed exposure.

### Parent and Helper Orchestration

The parent/helper relationship is already well defined.

The parent side currently handles:

- task creation,
- classification,
- decomposition decisions,
- helper selection,
- result review,
- consensus handling,
- reassembly,
- and final response production.

The helper side currently handles:

- safe capsule validation,
- non-executable reasoning work,
- bounded result production,
- evidence generation,
- and result submission.

This means the system is already a structured coordination engine rather than an unbounded agent swarm.

### Result Review and Scoring

Result review is real and local.

The current review flow can:

- score helpfulness,
- score quality,
- mark harmful output,
- reject unsolicited work,
- issue local review outcomes,
- and award contribution credit on accepted work.

In addition, the system already includes a scoreboard model with separate dimensions for provider contribution, validator participation, and trust.

This scoreboard-first design is one of the healthiest parts of the project, because it allows network behavior to be studied before pretending that settlement is trustless.

### Anti-Abuse and Fraud Detection

The anti-abuse layer is not complete, but it is already serious.

It includes detection patterns for:

- self-farming,
- repeated pair farming,
- ring-style low-diversity interaction,
- duplicate result reuse,
- suspicious peer behavior,
- and capability spoofing checks.

The system also has challenge and benchmark hooks for spot-check style verification, along with trust penalties and slashing hooks for severe abuse cases.

The latest hardening pass also added a baseline abuse-propagation path:

- typed `REPORT_ABUSE` payloads,
- dedupe tracking for already-seen abuse reports,
- bounded gossip forwarding with TTL and fanout limits,
- and local fraud-signal recording when a report is accepted.

This is not full adversarial security yet, but it is much stronger than a naive “whoever replies first wins” model.

### Storage and Persistence

The local persistence layer is substantial.

The system now stores:

- tasks,
- capsules,
- offers,
- claims,
- assignments,
- results,
- reviews,
- peer endpoints,
- capabilities,
- anti-abuse signals,
- finalized responses,
- score deltas,
- and supporting audit records.

On top of that, the hardening pass added:

- content-addressed storage for chunked payloads,
- manifest tracking,
- an append-only event log,
- and an event hash chain for tamper-evident local history.

This means the node now preserves both operational state and a stronger historical record of what happened.

### Traceability and Lifecycle Tracking

The system now has explicit trace and task lifecycle primitives.

A task can now be followed through:

- creation,
- offering,
- claiming,
- assignment,
- running,
- completion,
- timeout,
- dispute,
- and finalization.

This is important because distributed systems become hard to reason about when they only mutate rows and statuses without lineage. The new trace and state model makes the local mesh much easier to inspect and audit.

### Sandbox Hardening

The system still preserves a local-only safety-first execution posture.

The hardening pass added clearer execution controls around:

- bounded execution policy,
- workspace restriction,
- network egress blocking by default,
- command parsing without shell-first behavior,
- output limits,
- timeout limits,
- and a pluggable execution backend shape.

The current execution posture remains conservative, which is the correct stance at this stage.

### Optional Sidecars and Integration Direction

Liquefy-side telemetry and optional anchoring/payment-related hooks still exist, but they remain optional.

That means:

- local NULLA can remain usable on its own,
- sidecar integrations do not define whether the product exists,
- and future integration into the wider OpenClaw and DNA ecosystem can happen without turning standalone NULLA into a non-functional shell.

That separation is good and should be preserved.

## What Improved In The Hardening Pass

The current state is stronger than the earlier handover suggested.

The hardening pass fixed several classes of problems:

### 1. Portability and Runtime Consistency

The system no longer depends on a hard-coded machine-specific runtime layout.

It now behaves like a local workspace-managed application rather than something pinned to one prior machine setup.

### 2. Honest Status Separation

The project now has an explicit implementation-status document separating:

- implemented,
- partial,
- simulated,
- and planned.

This is important because the biggest documentation weakness before this pass was overstating completion by mixing proven LAN functionality with future public-network and economic claims.

### 3. Better Consensus Framing

The system now has a verdict-oriented layer instead of leaning only on “agreement equals truth.”

That means the architecture is now better aligned with how LLM and reasoning systems actually behave:

- evidence sufficiency matters,
- conflict classification matters,
- confidence weighting matters,
- and disagreement is treated as a real state rather than just noise.

This is much more honest and much safer.

### 4. Better Local Auditability

Trace records, manifests, event logs, and hash chaining now make the node more inspectable.

This is valuable both for debugging and for future trust arguments.

### 5. Safer Economic Framing

Credits, DEX behavior, and DNA-linked purchase flows are now explicitly treated as simulated unless stronger settlement guarantees exist.

That prevents the system from pretending to have a production-grade trustless economy before the ledger and reconciliation layers are truly mature.

### 6. Identity-Cost Baseline Is Now Policy-Driven

Capability advertisements now include declared PoW difficulty, and validation enforces a policy-driven minimum identity-work threshold.

This is still not a full hostile-world Sybil defense, but it is now configurable policy instead of only a fixed magic number.

### 7. SQLite Write-Contention Safety Is Stronger

The runtime now enforces:

- WAL mode,
- foreign keys,
- busy timeout,
- and normal synchronous mode

on DB connections used by local services.

This improves lock behavior and lowers the chance of avoidable write failures during long mixed workloads.

### 8. DigitalOcean IP-First Deployment Pack Is Live

The repository now includes a practical four-node closed-test deployment pack:

- three regional meet nodes,
- one separate watcher node,
- one-shot bootstrap script,
- and config-driven startup wrappers.

This gives a real bridge from local/LAN proof to controlled internet-connected team testing without changing architecture.

### 9. Large-Payload Data Plane Is No Longer UDP-Size-Bound

The transport path now handles oversized mesh payloads without silent drop at datagram ceiling:

- stream-first transfer for oversized payloads,
- UDP fragmentation fallback with receiver-side reassembly,
- split limits for `max_datagram_bytes` and `max_message_bytes`.

This closes the earlier hard wall where larger envelopes could not traverse the mesh path reliably.

### 10. Meet TLS And Mesh Wire Encryption Are Now Supported

Meet-and-greet now supports optional TLS server configuration:

- certificate and key on meet nodes,
- optional CA for client-certificate posture,
- HTTPS replication client trust configuration.

Mesh transport now also supports:

- optional AES-GCM wire encryption using a shared key for closed test clusters,
- optional strict encryption mode that rejects plaintext mesh payloads,
- optional TLS for the stream data-plane used by oversized payload transfer.

### 11. Sandbox Network Isolation Is Stronger

The sandbox still defaults to conservative policy checks, and now also supports OS-level isolation mode:

- Linux kernel-level isolation via `bwrap --unshare-net`, `unshare -n`, or `firejail --net=none` when available,
- strict `os_enforced` mode that fails closed if OS-level network isolation is unavailable.

### 12. Verification Baseline Is Current

Latest local automated verification (this repo state):

- `736 passed, 14 skipped, 29 xfailed` via GitHub Actions CI (2026-03-16).

### 13. Helper Execution Is No Longer Template-Only

Helper execution now attempts real model-backed reasoning first via the existing model execution infrastructure:

- `sandbox/helper_worker.py` now routes helper task reasoning through `ModelTeacherPipeline` when providers are available,
- results keep non-executable scope constraints and response-size budgeting,
- fallback deterministic templates still exist as a safety net when no model backend is available.

This closes the largest realism gap in helper execution while preserving local-first reliability.

### 14. Meet Server Observability Baseline Exists

Meet-and-greet now includes an operational metrics surface:

- `/metrics` exports Prometheus-style counters and latency gauge,
- `/v1/metrics` returns a JSON snapshot for internal tooling,
- counters track total requests, error totals, status distribution, route distribution, and average latency.

This gives closed-test operators concrete runtime visibility without external observability infrastructure.

## What Is Partial Right Now

The project is stronger now, but some parts are still correctly marked partial.

### WAN and Public Network Readiness

There is now a real shape for:

- NAT probing,
- endpoint classification,
- hole-punch attempt logic,
- bootstrap registry behavior,
- relay fallback behavior,
- and a stream transport layer for larger payloads.

But this is still not the same thing as a hardened public internet mesh.

What exists now is a readiness layer and modular infrastructure, not a fully proven hostile-world deployment layer.

### Consensus Follow-Through

Verdict logic exists and local review now uses it, but broader consensus behavior still needs deeper integration and long-run validation under real multi-peer disagreement.

The architecture is in a much better place than before, but this should still be described as partially hardened rather than fully solved.

### DHT and Public Routing

A lightweight DHT exists and the daemon can work with peer routing information, but this is still not a hardened global routing fabric.

It is useful in the current stage, but it should still be treated as partial rather than production-grade.

## What Is Simulated Right Now

The system is honest now about what is not yet production-trustworthy.

### Credits

The internal credit ledger exists and now has stronger replay and balance protection, but it is still a local accounting layer, not a trustless public settlement layer.

### DEX Behavior

Market-style credit exchange behavior exists only as simulated behavior. It should not be treated as a production market.

### DNA and Payment Rails

The DNA-linked payment bridge remains an integration shape and simulation path, not a final trustless settlement mechanism.

At the same time, payment UX now has a real local hot/cold wallet control layer:

- hot wallet balance can be consumed automatically by the agent for credit purchases,
- cold wallet operations require explicit user approval via a local secret,
- user can top up hot from cold,
- user can move funds back from hot to cold,
- and each wallet move is recorded in a local wallet ledger.

This gives controlled, user-safe operational behavior now, while settlement remains explicitly simulated.

## What The System Is Best Described As Today

The most honest full description is this:

Decentralized NULLA is currently a working local-first distributed agent orchestration system with a real standalone mode and a real LAN mesh mode.

It already includes:

- signed peer messaging,
- task decomposition and helper assignment,
- safe task capsules,
- result review,
- contribution scoring,
- anti-abuse primitives,
- local persistence,
- lifecycle traceability,
- content-addressed storage,
- and optional external integration hooks.

It is strongest today as:

- a local intelligence system,
- a trusted local swarm,
- a home or office cluster orchestration layer,
- and a prototype-to-pre-production distributed reasoning platform.

It is not yet best described as:

- a hostile-public-internet compute market,
- a trustless decentralized execution economy,
- or a finished payment-settled open swarm.

That distinction matters, and the documentation is now aligned with it.

## Why This Is Still Valuable Right Now

Even without full public-network hardening, this is already meaningful software.

It proves:

- the product works on one machine,
- the mesh path is real,
- safe distributed reasoning can be structured,
- local-first utility can coexist with swarm augmentation,
- and reputation plus anti-abuse can be developed before real settlement is turned on.

That makes the current system valuable as both:

- a usable local AI architecture,
- and a serious distributed systems testbed.

## The Core Truth Going Forward

What we have now is not a toy and not vapor.

It is a real local and LAN-capable decentralized-agent platform with working orchestration and meaningful hardening.

At the same time, it now documents its limits more clearly:

- public-network readiness is partial,
- economic settlement is simulated,
- and the internet-scale trust model is not yet complete.

That honesty makes the project stronger, not weaker, because it makes the current achievement legible:

NULLA already works as a standalone device feature and as a trusted local swarm, and it now has a far cleaner foundation for everything that comes next.
